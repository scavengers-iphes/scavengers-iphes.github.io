    <p>Middle Paleolithic archaeological sites are often the product of overlapped activities and/or occupations that also involve disruptive processes. The results are palimpsests with a disordered appearance that can confuse interpretations. 

      <p>The problem is worsened when some agents, such as carnivore scavengers, act on the archaeological record, causing the remains to disappear and leaving no obvious signs of their passage. 
      </p>
        <p>SCAVENGERS consists of monitoring experimental reproductions of hearth-related assemblages (like those described in archaeological contexts) exposed to different species of wild carnivores: hyenas, lions, bears, wolves, and other smaller carnivores. The results will then be subsequently tested on different Middle Palaeolithic assemblages using Deep Learning through computer techniques based on convolutional neural networks. 
        </p>
          <p>The main aim is to generate enough cross-sectional data that can be applied to all periods and geographic areas, overcoming the limits of traditional archaeological methods to make accurate inferences about past human behaviour. The results of this project will contribute to the development of a new paradigm, changing some basic ideas about prehistory. 
          </p>
            <p>Scavengers project will create a huge quantity of variables from neo-taphonomy studies in an unprecedented that the accumulated information and experience will provide valuable data and information for other areas of knowledge, such as those related to naturalistic studies, animal behaviour, and management of natural resource/parks.
